# Scholarly Providers Documentation

Build reliable scholarly features without juggling raw HTTP for OpenAlex, Semantic Scholar (S2), and Crossref. This package unifies provider contracts, normalizes payloads, adds retries + caching, and exports rich graphs ready for analysis or visualization.

- Getting Started: quick wins and why not raw HTTP → getting-started.md
- Contracts Reference: `Query`, `Paginator`, `ScholarlyDataSource` → contracts.md
- Graphs & Algorithms: citation/collaboration graphs + exporters → graph.md
- Adapters: OpenAlex, S2, Crossref specifics → adapters/
- Extending: build your own adapter and add features → extending.md
- Laravel: framework integration, config, and facade → laravel.md

If you are new, start with getting-started.md, then skim contracts.md and graph.md.
