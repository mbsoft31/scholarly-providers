# Semantic Scholar (S2) Adapter

Implements `ScholarlyDataSource` against the Semantic Scholar Graph API with offset pagination and high-throughput batch endpoints.

Highlights
- Endpoints: `/paper/search`, `/paper/{id}`, `/author/search`, `/paper/{id}/citations`, `/paper/{id}/references`, `/paper/batch`, `/author/batch`
- Auth: `x-api-key` header (optional but recommended)
- Pagination: numeric `offset` with `next` token; adapter supports both `offset` and `cursor`
- Batching: up to 500 IDs per call, chunked transparently

Search works/authors
```php
$works = $s2->searchWorks(Query::from(['q' => 'transformers', 'limit' => 100]));
$authors = $s2->searchAuthors(Query::from(['q' => 'goodfellow']));
```

Lookup & lists
```php
$s2->getWorkById('s2:123');
$s2->listReferences('s2:123', Query::from(['limit' => 200]));
```

Batch
```php
foreach ($s2->batchWorksByIds(['s2:1','s2:2','s2:3'], Query::from(['fields' => ['id','title']])) as $work) {}
```

Configuration
- Set `S2_API_KEY` (Laravel) or pass `['s2' => ['api_key' => '...']]` to `AdapterFactory::make()`.

Notes
- External IDs (DOI/arXiv/PMID) are mapped under `external_ids`.
- Open access metadata (`is_oa`, `oa_url`) is normalized when available.
